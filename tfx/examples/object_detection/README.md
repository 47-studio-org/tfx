# Tensorflow Object Detection Example

This Example pipeline has one extra dependency:

- `tf_models`: for providing the training algorithm implementation.

To try this example, install tfx using

```
pip install -U tfx[examples]
```

The example demonstrates using scaled_yolo model implementation from tf models.
